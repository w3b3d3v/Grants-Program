## Project Overview :page_facing_up:
Web3dev is the largest and most engaged web3 developers community in LATAM.

We already have a Discord with more than 1800 developers: https://bit.ly/w3b3d3v/ Our community is organized in pods, each pod for a different theme or blockchain. Each pod has a leader, which helps that pod to evolve, promoting growth to the ecosystem and the whole web3dev community.

We already have leaders for Ethereum, Cardano, NEAR, Algorand, Solana, Terra. We incentivize those pods, creating bounties and paying individual contributors when they create new content and deliver value. 

### Overview

There are thousands of great developers in Brazil eager to get into Terra, but English-only content is still a limitation. We are building a developers community for web3 technologies in Latin America. We engage people to translate English content and also produce original content for specific blockchains.

Our objective is to bring thousands of web2 developers to the web3 world. Brazil is the biggest economy in Latin America and has thousands of high talent developers. When more Brazilian developers have the tools to build innovative solutions, Polkadot blockchain can be used to solve different problems in Brazil such as agro-business green certification, forest devastation, environmental issues, better wealth distribution and hunger.

We have limited resources to invest on all specific blockchains, so this partnership could accelerate the adoption of Polkadot and Substrate blockchains in Brazilian crypto startups.

### Project Details

We expect to have 20,000 developers in our community by the end of 2022. We expect to reach at least 2,000 of them with specific Polkadot blockchain ecosystem content, some of them being able to work and deliver value on real projects in the Polkadot ecosystem.

We already have a sustainable and proved business model in web2 space, and we will replicate the same model for web3 projects. Our sustainable flyweel is:

1) create a solid and engaged community
2) educate / train the community members on web3 technologies through effective learning experiences like bootcamps, workshops, hackathons
3) match our community talents with market opportunities, helping them to have real experience with web3 projects. We build teams for web3 projects
4) manage these teams and make sure the projects are successful and have positive impact
5) reinvest everything we earn from these projects into the community, advertising to more developers, training more people and giving more opportunities for everyone

Use of Funds: we will use the funds to create technical video and written content about Polkadot in Brazilian Portuguese. We will advertise this content for our more than 1,800 developers

3 months of ongoing content creation:
- 15 videos - 5 per month, 3 months to produce, publish and advertise
- 15 text articles - 5 per month, 3 months to produce, publish and advertise

- $4,500 for 15 videos (cost per video: $300)
- $2,700 for 15 articles (cost per article: $180)
- $2,000 for editorial and publishing coordination

Total $9,200

Our success funnel will be:

1. Content Delivered (15 videos and 15 articles)
2. Plays / Pageviews - expectation: 6k
3. Unique Devs views - expectation: 600
4. Community Devs Working in Polkadot Projects

### Ecosystem Fit

There is a lot of space for Polkadot adoption growth in Latin America. We will help with this growth through education and content generation to create awareness and engagement. Polkadot is one of the most promising blockchain technologies in the space, but yet to be discovered and adopted in Latin America
